# Immergence Studios Website

This is the official website for **Immergence Studios**, an animation studio focused on producing world-class animation content.

## Built With

- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development environment
- **React** - Modern UI library for building interactive web applications
- **TypeScript** - Static typing for improved developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Design and Visuals

The website design is custom-made, with particular attention to selecting images, videos, and GIFs that fit the overall color scheme and theme of Immergence Studios. The media used throughout the site was sourced from **Pinterest**. While I was unable to track down the individual creators of each asset, Iâ€™ve curated a [Pinterest board](https://za.pinterest.com/thembamtshelwane/immergence-studios-demo/) where all the visuals can be found, giving credit to the artists.

## What I Learned

Building this website has been a valuable learning experience, particularly in choosing visuals that complement the design and enhance the user experience. I added background music tp tie the theme all together. I also gained more proficiency with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

- Creating a design and theme.
- Using the staggered text effect.
- Using thee glitch text effect.
- Using background music.

## Limitations
