# Immergence Studios Website

This is the official website for **Immergence Studios**, an animation studio focused on producing world-class animation content.

## Built With

- **Vite** - Lightning-fast development environment
- **React** - Modern UI library for building interactive web applications
- **TypeScript** - Static typing for improved developer experience
- **Tailwind CSS** - Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development

## Design and Visuals

The website design is custom-made, with particular attention to selecting images, videos, and GIFs that fit the overall color scheme and theme of Immergence Studios. The media used throughout the site was sourced from **Pinterest**. While I was unable to track down the individual creators of each asset, Iâ€™ve curated a [Pinterest board](https://za.pinterest.com/thembamtshelwane/immergence-studios-demo/) where all the visuals can be found, giving credit to the artists.

## What I Learned

Building this website has been a valuable learning experience, particularly in choosing visuals that complement the design and enhance the user experience. I also gained more proficiency with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS.

## Limitations

The curent website does not include all its features, i.e. a section showcaing the team and the contact section.

## Live Website

Please check it out. I am always open for suggestions and collaboration [Immergence Studios](https://immergence-studios.vercel.app/)
